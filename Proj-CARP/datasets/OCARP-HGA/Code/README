- Instructions -

CMake [1] and GCC [2] are required to compile the code.
LEMON [3] library is used for graph manipulation.
LEMON should be installed in a folder where g++ can locate it automatically (depending on your Linux distribution) [4], otherwise the flags to include headers and libraries should be explicited in the compiler command-line invocation (edit 'CMakeLists.txt' file in this case).

$> cmake .
$> make
$> ./HGA_OCARP <#Vehicles M*+(0/1/2)> {-t <time_limit> (seconds)}
